"""
plex/playlists/universe_order.py — saga (timeline) order + TV franchise grouping, derived
from Kometa Plex universe collections (read IN COLLECTION ORDER) with a curated TV fallback.
================================================================================
The playlist brain orders a universe/franchise block by ``timeline_index`` (which OVERRIDES
release/air date) and groups TV siblings by ``franchise``. Neither is populated by default —
this module produces the maps the resolvers consume:

  • movies  → ``{tmdb_id: position}``      (fed to ``movie_inputs(universe_order=…)``)
  • TV      → ``{series_id: franchise}`` + ``{series_id: position}``
              (fed to ``tv_inputs(franchise_by_series=…, series_timeline=…)``)

Two sources, merged with Kometa winning:
  1. KOMETA — the operator's "Universe Collections" in Plex. We match a collection's title to
     a universe key (``UNIVERSE_COLLECTION_NAMES``), then read its children in collection order
     (Kometa preserves the IMDb/mdblist list order it was built from = the saga order). Covers
     the film universes the operator already maintains.
  2. CURATED — ``CURATED_TV_FRANCHISES``: sibling TV shows NOT expressible as a single Kometa
     film-universe collection (One Chicago, Law & Order, Doctor Who, …). Editable; keyed by
     series TITLE (a trailing ``(year)`` is ignored) so it resolves against any install.

IMPORTANT — Kometa "universe" vs "franchise" (verified from a real meta.log + parquet):
Kometa runs TWO collection defaults. (a) ``universe`` (mcu, star, trek, …) is IMDb/mdblist-
sourced with a CUSTOM order ⇒ this is the only source of in-universe TIMELINE order, and the
only thing this module reads for ``timeline_index``. (b) ``franchise`` is per-TMDB-collection
with ``collection_order: release`` and tags BOTH Radarr (``item_radarr_tag: <<key>>, franchise``)
AND Sonarr (``item_sonarr_tag``). For MOVIES the franchise ``<<key>>`` IS the ``collection_tmdb_id``
glidearr already groups on (e.g. 2 Fast 2 Furious → tag ``9485`` == its collection id) and is
release-ordered, so franchise collections add NOTHING for movies — we never read them. For TV,
franchise/universe collections also exist as SHOW-library Plex collections; reading those gives
sibling-show GROUPING (franchise token = collection title), but — being release-ordered — only
universe (custom-order) show collections carry a saga ``timeline_index``; a franchise show
collection contributes grouping only (air-date handles its order). (glidearr does not cache
Sonarr series tags today, so the Plex show collection is the read path, not the Sonarr tag.)

PURE — no I/O. The manager fetches collections + ordered children + the owned inventories and
passes plain dicts/lists here; everything below is deterministic + unit-testable.
